PyFitTools
==========

About
-----

Messing around with parsing binary .FIT files from my GPS. The goal is to 
write commandline tools to help extract data from the .FIT files and create
meaningful information when used in coordination with other timestamped data.

Usage
-----

You will need to create a data directory inside the repository and populate it 
with valid .FIT files.

More
----

I am using documentation from http://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit to create these
tools.
